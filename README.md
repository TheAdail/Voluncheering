# Our Big Kitchen for Volunteers

## OBK
A non-profit organisation providing food and services for the community.
They rely basically on volunteers to get things done, thus having a
VRMS (Volunteer Relationship Management System) is essential for their operations.

Visit www.obk.org.au to know more about them.

## Short History
This product started with a prototype using Swift for the mobile app, Ruby on Rails (API mode) for the back-end,
Angular 2 for the back office web app, and PostgreSql.

Then at an RHoK (Random Acts of Kindness) hackathon we've got a huge help from UX Designers, a Product Manager,
a Customer Experience expert, a Growth hacker, and defined much of the product and user requirements.

We decided to use React Native for the mobile app, React for the back office web app, and Firebase for the back-end.

This repo is only for the React Native mobile app.
